This repository contains several test and preliminary notebooks and python files. The main final files for each of our objectives are in the final_code folder, and they are: 

1. Objective 1 - 
     objective_1_final.ipynb - pre-processing, implementation of 2HL NN & analysis
2. Objective 2 - 
     objective_2_pre_proc.ipynb - pre-processing done to modify the strings of text and label the observations
     objective_2_final.ipynb - implementation of LSTM NN. 
3. Objective 3 - 

Code referenced in the files include: 
- Tutorials from PyTorch 
- https://github.com/claravania/lstm-pytorch/blob/master/model.py for LSTM implementation 
- https://github.com/yuchenlin/lstm_sentence_classifier/ for LSTM implementation 
- Code for homework 1 of the Advanced Machine Learning class.
